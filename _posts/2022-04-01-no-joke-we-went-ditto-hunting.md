The family went on a Pokémon hunt to catch Dittos tonight! I wanted to go walking Wednesday, but I was still sore from my little adventure on Tuesday. Thursday got rained out. I was going to be lazy and not go tonight, but there was a special event on Pokémon GO, and I couldn’t resist. ![😀](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/tce/1/16/1f600.png)

Plus, Jennifer Tucker took the boys for the night, so we didn’t have to herd any cats along the Riverwalk. ![🐈](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t54/1/16/1f408.png)![🐈‍⬛](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t3/1/16/1f408_200d_2b1b.png)![😹](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t34/1/16/1f639.png)

I love how we scribbled all over The Fresh Market. We stopped to get a drink because I forgot I had to take my pain meds! 🤣👴🏻
