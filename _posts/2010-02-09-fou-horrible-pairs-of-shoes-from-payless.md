[![Horrible shoes from Payless Shoesource](https://www.rayhollister.com/media/2010/02/PRE_2010-02-10-011621-150x150.jpg "Horrible shoes from Payless Shoesource")](/media/2010/02/PRE_2010-02-10-011621.jpg)I admit that I’m not much of a shoe aficionado. I normally buy whatever dress shoe style that [Target](http://www.target.com) is carrying these days, and years ago, before we had a Target in our neighborhood, I would just grab whatever [Wal-Mart](http://www.walmart.com) had in stock. Just before Christmas, my wife and I decided to buy a couple new dress shoes for me and a couple of dressy casual shoes for her. We checked out Target first, but decided to visit [Payless Shoesource](http://www.payless.com/store/ "Payless Shoesource") since they were right next door and there were *HUGE* [BOGO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buy_one,_get_one_free "Buy one, get one free - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.") signs out front. I was surprised when I found two pairs of shoes that were *very* similar to the ones that I had picked out at Target, but they looked nicer, and they were cheaper! I decided to get a black pair of [traditional oxford style dress shoes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_shoe) and a black pair of [square toed oxford dress shoes](http://www.payless.com/store/product/detail.jsp?skuId=018433055&productId=8045&subCatId=cat90002&catId=cat10089&lotId=018433&category=&catdisplayName=Mens+ "Mens - State Street - Rochester Oxford - Payless Shoes"). My wife decided to get a pair of sequined black loafers and a pair of black ballet flats. For the first few weeks, they were great. The shoes were comfortable and solid.

The material had started separating. I felt dumb because when I examined them closely I realized that they were not leather. They were made of artificial materials. I looked at the Oxfords and the same was true, more pleather. Admittedly, this was my own fault for buying fake leather, but I was still ticked off. They even smelled like real leather.

They felt as if I was falling to the left and the ball of my feet felt like they were in a depression, kind of like when you step on a crack on the sidewalk. I examined the bottom of my shoes and found that the soles had worn out and were deeply cracked. I looked at the back of the left shoe and the sole was separated from the upper.

Again, I am not a shoe aficionado, but the cheap shoes that I picked up from the discount department stores usually lasted at least a year before I would start to have problems like this. These shoes basically falling apart in under 60 days is just completely unacceptable. In all fairness to Payless they do have a decent [return policy](http://www.payless.com/store/home/productinfo.jsp#QaulityAssurance "Returns & Exchanges - Payless Shoes"), and if I could find my blasted receipt, I would be taking them back to the store. However, I am like most people, and I have no idea where it would be, if I even still have it.

As if this wasn’t bad enough, my wife’s shoes also fell apart.

So, will I be shopping at Payless again? Probably not. If I do, I will make sure to get the receipt and I will laminate it and frame it.
