[![](http://deemable.com/media/2012/09/iPhone5-300x300.jpg "iPhone 5 Front, Back and Side.")](http://deemable.com/2012/09/the-iphone-5-is-here-whoopidy-doo/)After the obligatory months and months of iPhone rumors, Apple has finally announced its latest smartphone, the iPhone 5. If you were waiting with bated breath for something new and exciting, go watch the [iOS 6.0 announcement from WWDC back in June](http://www.apple.com/apple-events/june-2012/ "Apple - Apple Events - Apple Special Event June 2012"). The only really exciting features in the new iPhone 5 are the features that come with iOS 6.0, which is coming to the iPhone 3Gs, iPhone 4, and iPhone 4S on September 19th. In fact, I can sum up [the differences between the iPhone 4S and the iPhone 5](http://www.apple.com/iphone/compare-iphones/ "Apple - iPhone 5 - Compare specifications between iPhone models.") in under sixteen words: it’s a little bit taller, a little bit lighter, a little bit thinner, and it’s faster. That’s it. Oh, and it has a new connector that doesn’t work with any of the accessories you already have, but you’ll be able to buy an adapter. The only thing that the iPhone 5 can do that the iPhone 4S can’t do, other than showing an extra bar of icons, is take pictures while I’m shooting video. I guess that’s kinda cool…
