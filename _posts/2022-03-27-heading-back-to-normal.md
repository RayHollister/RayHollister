I skipped a few days posting because after all that excitement, I was worn out. I thankfully got a LOT of sleep this weekend which felt amazing.

I wanted to go for a longer walk this weekend, but timing didn’t quite work out right either days. I’m gonna make a point of it tomorrow though.

Before the day was over I decided I had to get out of the house and walk for a little bit. So, I went to one of the least exciting places in the world, the grocery store! But as I walked in, I realized I haven’t been to a grocery store in over a month. It was kinda amazing. It almost felt normal.

Yeah, I bought some junk food. 😁 Don’t worry, I’m still eating pretty healthy thanks in no small part to the amazing folks who have brought us meals over the last few weeks.

T-63 days

Thank you again to everyone that has helped us over these past few weeks. It’s been a wild ride, and it would have been a lot more chaotic without you.

The bills are just now starting to roll in. It’s looking like it’s gonna be at least $5,000. That would suck, but it wouldn’t be too crazy by itself. But I’m the fourth out of the five members of our little family to spend a few days in the hospital over the last 6 months. I’ll share some more about that tomorrow.
