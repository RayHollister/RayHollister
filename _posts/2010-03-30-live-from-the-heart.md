This is a video project I did a voice over for a few years ago for [CrossRoad Church](http://www.crcumc.org). Unfortunately, the audio quality isn’t amazing, but I still love this project. I should probably rerecord it and remaster it. The amazing art work is by [Ambler Hutchinson](http://www.amblerhutchinson.com/), the music is [Svefn g Englar](http://www.sigur-ros.co.uk/band/disco/svefn.php) by [Sigur Ros](http://www.sigur-ros.co.uk), the words are from [“Waking the Dead”](http://www.ransomedheart.com/node/660 "Waking the Dead (Paperback)  | Ransomed Heart Ministries") by [John Eldredge](http://www.ransomedheart.com). The video was created by [Joshua Holdman.](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/josh-holdman/3/6b3/76a)
