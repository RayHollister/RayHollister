Some folks asked for this, so here it is. This is what I am planning on doing, and the order I plan on doing it in. If anyone wants to help, let me know! I’m doing this all for free.

| Version # | Changes or Planned Changes |
|---|---|
| 0.0.1 | Added Bus Schedules Header, List of Bus Schedules with hyperlinks to JTA website. |
| 0.0.2 | Changed background color and spaced out the list to make it easier to tap. |
| 0.0.3 | Added JTA logo and link to JTA homepage. |
| 0.5.0 | Converted text html list to Mojo List UI. It’s easier to tap and more natural for WebOS users. Added place holder cards for each schedule and put a Webview widget on each schedule card. Now you don’t have to leave the app to see the schedule on the JTA website. |
| 0.6.0 | Fixed missing cards. Added a header on each schedule card with a link to the actual website so you can open them in another card. Started importing schedule into the application. Added AR-3 Townsend-Regency schedule, links to the pdf version and the route map jpg to the app as a style test. |
| 0.6.1 | added Metrix and R-5 schedule, pdf, and route map jpg. |
| 0.6.2 | added WS-1 and WS-12, schedules, pdf, and route map jpg. |
| 0.6.3 | added P-4 schedules, pdf, and route map jpg. |
