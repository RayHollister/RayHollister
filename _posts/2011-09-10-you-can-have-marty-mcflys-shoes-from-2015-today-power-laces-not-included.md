![Marty checks out his new kicks.](http://deemable.com/media/2011/09/marty0.jpg "Marty checks out his new kicks.")

If you were a child of the 80’s like I was, you most likely remember that iconic moment in [Back to the Future Part II](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096874/ "IMDB Back To The Future Part II") when Marty arrives in 2015, and he has to change into clothes that fit the time period so he will pass for his future son. He puts on a jacket that looks five sizes too big for him, but with the press of a button it adjusts to fit him perfectly. Before he did that, he slipped on the coolest pair of high tops ever designed. The Nike MAGs had glowing lights (not really sure why, but they looked really cool), and everyone’s favorite part, they had automatic, power laces.

Today, [Nike](http://www.nike.com/) announced that they have made 1,500 2011 [Nike MAGs](http://nikemag.ebay.com/)! The sneakers are almost exactly like the shoes that Michael J. Fox wore in Back To The Future II, with one unfortunate exception. They do not have power laces, yet. According to Nike’s commercial starring Bill Hader, Christopher Lloyd, Tinker Hatfield, Donald Fullilove and Kevin Durant, this highly coveted feature won’t come out until 2015.

Nike is [auctioning these items of sneaker geek lust off on eBay](http://nikemag.eBay.com) with 100% of the net profits going to the [Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research](http://www.michaeljfox.org/ "The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research") starting tonight at 11:30 pm EST, and ending September 18th, 2011. Also, [Google](http://www.google.com/ "Google") Co-Founder, Sergey Brin has pledged a matching donation of up to $50 million. Michael J. Fox will appear on [The Late Show with David Letterman](http://www.cbs.com/late_night/late_show)* tonight wearing a pair of the famous shoes “[for the future](http://www.back4thefuture.com/)” to announce the auction.

Personally, I think this is a lot of fun, and I’m glad all of [the money is going to a great cause](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYMyEqRb2cw "YouTube - Back For The Future - A Message from Michael J. Fox"), but I’m hanging on to my money until somebody finally releases [a working hoverboard](http://gizmodo.com/5549271/a-real-working-hoverboard-exists)!
