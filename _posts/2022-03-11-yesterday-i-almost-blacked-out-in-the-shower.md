The doctors told me that I should be able take a brief shower standing up without the brace by this week. I carefully climbed in the shower, and Amber washed my legs. Then, I gently removed my brace and stood perfectly still while Amber helped me wash the rest of me.

I was doing great right up until I started washing my hair. The combination of standing, holding my hands over my head and the tingle of the Head and Shoulders was apparently too much to handle. I started to pass out. My ears started to ring, my knees went limp, the room got dark and my vision started tunneling. I held onto the top of the shower rail while Amber sprayed me down with cold water to help me recover. Then she got me back in the brace and walked me to bed.

My hair and beard were still covered in shampoo, so after I stabilized, Amber helped me back to the shower, and this time she insisted that I sit in the chair. She rinsed and dried me off, and got me back in my brace. The whole ordeal was terrifying for me and Amber. It will be a while before I try that again, and I’m sure I’ll be in the chair to start next time.

I was so worn out, I spent most of the rest of the day in bed and did several conference calls from my pillow. My coworkers have all seen my bedroom now! Fortunately, most of Amber’s fluffy pillows were out of the scene.

T-79 days.

P.S. I’m terrible at accepting help, but a lot of folks have offered, and I am immensely grateful. A couple of our friends, Tom Braun and Melissa Aiuppy, have set up accounts on GoFundMe and Meal Train if that’s something you would like to do.

I’m so grateful for all of you.
