Apply the principles of the KonMari method, from the book “The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up.”

Go through your computer and get rid of documents &amp; files you don’t need and/or don’t bring you joy.

Give everything a home.

#### First, back it up!

You remember how the last time you did Spring Cleaning you accidently threw out something you didn’t mean to? You can buy a new wafflemaker, but you can never get those baby photos back.

Make sure you have everything backed up in at least two separate locations before you begin.

Time Machine – Mac  
Backup &amp; Restore – Windows

#### Use the snowball technique to stay motivated.

Start with the easy things and work your way up to the harder stuff.

Start with your Favorites. Go through your bookmarks and clear the ones you don’t need any more. Then depending on which has less files in it, start organizing the Desktop or your My Document folder.

Don’t go crazy, but start to make some sense out of the chaos. Put your financial records in one folder. Put all of your pictures together. Put all of your kids homework assignments in another folder.

Make a folder to put everything you can’t decide if you need it anymore. Revisit it in a few weeks and see if you have opened any of them. If not, let them go.

#### Uninstall programs you don’t need anymore.

[Revo Uninstaller](https://www.cleverbridge.com/884/?affiliate=45874&scope=checkout&cart=96705) is a great app for deep scrubbing the gunk from your computer and making sure the entire program is removed.
