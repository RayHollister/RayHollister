The summertime is a great time for your kids to rest their minds, but if they rest too much it makes it harder to get back into the swing of things next school year. Here are four apps your kids will enjoy that will also keep their mind in great shape to slow down the summer slide.

If you have little ones, they’re going to love this one. Khan Academy Kids did an amazing job of making a game that’s fun and educational. My boys love this one.

Khan Academy did a fantastic job of incorporating a complete lesson plan full of math, logic, spelling and reading into a narrative game. So instead of just flipping back and forth between lessons, you go from one level of the game to the next.

### [The Human Body](https://tinybop.com/apps/the-human-body)

Teaches kids biology and anatomy, but instead of being gross and forcing you to dissect a frog or look at nasty pictures of organs, it shows the body in cartoon form. Accurate, but much more gentle.

It’s really interactive too. So you can wave flowers under their nose and you’ll see how the nervous system carries the “smell” message from the nose to the brain. Or you can feed him and watch the food go through the digestive system and see how each organ works.

### [DuoLingo](https://www.duolingo.com/)

Sometimes the best way to keep the brain working is by learning something new, like a new language. With DuoLingo you can learn a lot of languages for free. You can even learn Klingon and High Valerian!

It starts pretty easily and gradually gets harder as you progress. So even if your kid has already passed Spanish II or you’re just taking a trip to Paris this summer, this app is super useful and it’s fun. You can compete against each other too.

### [Math Bingo](https://www.abcya.com/games/math_bingo) – [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/math-bingo/id371338715?mt=8)

This one is great, even for adults. Especially if you’re like me and your arithmetic is a little rusty because maybe you pull out your calculator on your cell phone a little too often.

With Math Bingo, it turns math practice into a game. Instead of calling out bingo numbers, the game gives you a quick math problem to solve. The faster you can solve five problems in a row, the faster you get to BINGO!
