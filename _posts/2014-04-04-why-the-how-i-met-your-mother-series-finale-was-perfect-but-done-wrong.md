Or, “Everyone else has written a blog about the How I Met Your Mother series finale review so why don’t I?”

SPOILER: Don’t read any more if you haven’t seen the HIMYM finale.

Here’s the thing, the story in the HIMYM finale was excellent. It was a great love story. Actually, it was two great love stories: the story of the girl he fell in love with at first sight and was always in love with, and the story of the girl that was perfect for him and he married. They just implemented the story poorly.

They needed one more episode to give us more time with Tracy. Yeah, they gave us time with her in flash forwards in previous episodes, but come on! Other than a brief foreshadowing in the episode before the finale, we only knew she was sick and then died for a grand total of about 5 minutes!

They also cheated us on Barney and Robin. The entire last season was about their wedding day, but they were only married and then divorced for about five minutes in the last episode. Again, the story was right, but the implementation was wrong. Believing that Barney and Robin were going to work required a lot of willing suspension of disbelief. It went against the grain of their characters, but the show spent the entire last season convincing us it was going to work. Then, they pulled the rug out from under us in the last episode. Yeah, you can see that there was plenty of foreshadowing for it, especially if you marathon the last season like I did, but there wasn’t enough.

Lastly, I understand the technical difficulties in the production of the last episodes conclusion, but it looked stupid. The lighting was terrible, and Josh Radnor’s makeup looked rediculous. It would have been so much funnier if they would have just hung a lampshade on it and had Bob Saget, David Henrie and Lyndsy Fonseca film it recently.

Now, I knew about the twist at the end before I watched the last 6 episodes in a row. That gave me a different perspective than the folks who watched the show live, but I’m curious if anyone else sees it the way I do? Let me know in the comments down below.
