It’s almost a week before Thanksgiving here in the US, and some wild turkeys are fighting back.

Turkeys are taking over a neighborhood in New Jersey.

The township, which is coincidentally named Toms River, (because male Turkeys are called Toms) is being overrun with turkeys that are pecking cars, scaring people and even breaking windows.

Experts say that the turkeys are harmless, but if you’re confronted by a wild turkey, making loud noises, and opening and closing umbrellas can scare them off.

Whereas if you do that with Canadian Geese, you’re just gonna piss them off.

That’s all the news worth TikToking.
