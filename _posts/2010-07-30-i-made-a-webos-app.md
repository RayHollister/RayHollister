I can’t believe it! I watched one episode of the [Palm Developer Podcast](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LudDPBLDOjU) on YouTube and followed the [Ares app tutorial](http://ares.palm.com/Ares/docstemp/tutorial10.html). Then, I played around with [Ares](https://ares.palm.com/) and I created my first app! It was fairly super easy, especially considering I have never written an app before! Now, don’t get me wrong, my app stinks. It’s basically just a page of hyperlinks, but it looks cool! If you have a Palm WebOS device, check it out… I’ll post a link to it as soon as it is posted in the [Palm beta catalog](http://www.precentral.net/app-gallery/beta).
