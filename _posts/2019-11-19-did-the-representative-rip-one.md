Well, I guess this account has turned into a running fart joke, because here we go again.

Congressman Eric Swalwell appeared to let out a huge fart on live television.

> “The president used taxpayer dollars to ask the Ukrainians to help him cheat \[fart sound\] an election.”

> <cite>*Clip of Swalwell on MSNBC:*</cite>

Representative Swalwell from California’s 15th congressional district was speaking to Chris Matthews on MSNBC’s Hardball when he was interrupted by what sounded like a huge fart.

> “…cheat \[fart sound\] an election…”

> <cite>*Clip of Swalwell on MSNBC:*</cite>

Swalwell claims that he did neither smelt it nor dealt it.

In fact, he says he didn’t even hear it.

Some people came to the congressman‘s defense and said it must’ve been Chris Matthews who ripped one.

However, many viewers believe he slightly snickered when it happened.

[Hardball responded to the allegations on Twitter](https://twitter.com/hardball/status/1196639020056494081), and said that the sound heard was actually a coffee mug scraping across the desk.

I’ll leave that for you to decide.

That’s all the news worth TikToking.
