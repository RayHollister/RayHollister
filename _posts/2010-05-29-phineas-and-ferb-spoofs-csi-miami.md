Now for something completely different. Since I have a four year old daughter, I have an excuse to watch Disney Channel. One of Zoe’s favorite shows is the cartoon [Phineas and Ferb](http://tv.disney.go.com/disneychannel/phineasandferb/ "Phineas and Ferb"), a show about two brothers who are creative geniuses that take every seven year old boy’s craziest ideas and make them into realities, i.e. [building a roller coaster through a major city](http://phineasandferb.wikia.com/wiki/Rollercoaster "Phineas and Ferb - Episode 1 - Roller Coaster"), [going to Mars](http://phineasandferb.wikia.com/wiki/Unfair_Science_Fair_Redux_(Another_Story) "Phineas and Ferb - Unfair Science Fair Redux (Another Story)"), [traveling through time](http://phineasandferb.wikia.com/wiki/It's_About_Time "Phineas and Ferb - It's About Time!"), [making it snow in the summer](http://phineasandferb.wikia.com/wiki/S%27Winter "Phineas and Ferb - S'Winter"), etc. In true Saturday morning cartoon style, [their sister](http://phineasandferb.wikia.com/wiki/Candace_Flynn "Candace Flynn") plays the role of the “villain” that is always trying to “bust them” by showing their mother what they have done. They don’t seem to mind though, and they have even [assisted her in the busting](http://phineasandferb.wikia.com/wiki/Don't_Even_Blink) on one occasion. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to them, their [pet platypus](http://phineasandferb.wikia.com/wiki/Perry_the_Platypus "Perry the Platypus"), is a secret agent that is constantly disappearing to thwart the evil plots of his nemesis, a [clueless, evil scientist](http://phineasandferb.wikia.com/wiki/Heinz_Doofenshmirtz "Heinz Doofenshmirtz"). In true [deus ex machina](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina "God from the machine") style, these two plots usually come together with the [evil scientist’s new invention](http://phineasandferb.wikia.com/wiki/Doofenshmirtz's_schemes_and_inventions "Doofenshmirtz's Schemes and Inventions") inexplicably causing [the boys creations](http://phineasandferb.wikia.com/wiki/Big_Ideas "I know what we're going to do today!") to conveniently disappear or otherwise go away. OK, yeah, now that I wrote that all down, it does seem kinda crazy, but it is a fun show to watch. It’s also a heck of a lot more cerebral than [Thundercats](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088631/ "Thundercats (1985)") was!

Anyways, now that you have a general idea of what the show is about, in an episode that Zoe and I just watched, the boys pretend to be detectives on a manhunt for their sister’s lost doll. During the search, they do a montage of detective show parodies. The funniest one is when they parody the opening scene of CSI: Miami. They managed to squeeze in a total of 6 well used gags from both shows in only 21 seconds.
