Yep, those are my socks stuck to the back of my back brace.

We were getting ready to go for a walk before it got too late and Amber tossed me a pair of socks without looking. I didn’t know that Amber had thrown them to me, because in my turtle shell I couldn’t feel it at all. Zach found it quite hilarious.

After the cacophonous laughter died down, we went for a drive downtown to the St. Johns River and walked on the Southbank Riverwalk again. We walked about a 1/2 mile in total. Amber has now cleared me to go for walks on my own as long as I have my GPS on and shared with her.

I thought we were starting to get the bills, but instead we got a notification from our insurance that we had to have the surgeons complete a bunch of paperwork before we will find out what we’re responsible for. Ugh! We’re still in the dark as to how much this is all gonna end up costing.

Thank you to everyone who has helped us.
