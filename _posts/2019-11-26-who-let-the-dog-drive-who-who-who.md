A south Florida neighborhood woke up to the sounds of someone doing donuts in their cul-de-sac.

The sedan was driving around and around in circles in reverse, and who was behind the wheel? A black Labrador.

Fortunately police arrived on the scene shortly, and they were able to get the driver’s door open and the pooch jumped out.

One of the neighbors, Anne Sabol, told police that she thought he should be given a drivers license because it ONLY hit a mailbox and a few garbage cans.

Because that is how low the expectations are set for drivers in Florida.

That’s all the news worth TikToking.
