This was me last night, sitting up in my brace — *for way too long according to Amber* — putting together a bedside desk that finally arrived yesterday, even though I tried to order it on Sunday when I fell.

I sat on the couch while Zach and Will handed me each piece, and I put them together. It was nice getting to do something with my hands even though just sitting there was exhausting. Turning the wrench wore me out even faster. I can’t lift anything over 10 lbs. (Hmm, I wonder that that translates into wrench torque? Fortunately all the nuts in the kit were fairly easy to tighten.)

The sad irony was that I ended up spending most of today in bed. I’ll share that story tomorrow.

T-80 days.
