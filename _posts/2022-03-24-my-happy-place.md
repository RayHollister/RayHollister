Yesterday was already a fairly long day, but I convinced Amber to drive me to my happy place (Home Depot) last night and let me walk around for while. After I found the parts I needed to make some improvements to my bedside desk, I got to meander in the aisles while I “picked up things and scowled at them” according to Amber.

I got a little depressed when I saw some things that I wanted to get for projects that I forgot I will not be doing over the next couple of months.

But over all, it felt really great to feel a little normal for a while.
