The hot flashes. The hot flashes are so stupid and awful. I feel like I have early onset menopause! Every 30 to 60 minutes somebody turns the heat up to 90 degrees. I haven’t gone full Pedro from “Napoleon Dynamite” and shaved my head bald and beard off, but I’ve contemplated it many times.

The Gabapentin is the one giving me the heat waves. The Methocarbomal gives me the dizzy spells. But they’re keeping the pain at bay, so I can’t complain too much. Other then those, I’m taking Extra Strength Tylenol. I have Oxycodone but I’m trying to only take it if the pain is so much I can’t handle it anymore.
