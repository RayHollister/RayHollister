Yup, that’s me. You’re probably wondering how I ended up in this situation. LOL

On Sunday my son Zach had a birthday party to go to at the new skating rink in the old CompUSA in Regency. Since Amber has bad knees, and I used to skate a lot when I was younger, I decided I would take him.

We rented our skates, got them laced up and headed out on the floor. Since it was Zach‘s first time in rollerskates, it took him a while to get accustomed to them. For me, it only took about three laps around the floor to get my legs under me.

I noticed that Zach was still on the carpeted area, heading over to where the party was, and he was hugging the rail the whole time. I decided to take a break, and go walk him over to the party.

When I got to the exit, I grabbed ahold of the rail, but my feet went out from under me, and my legs flew under the rail. I landed on my butt hard, and I screamed as I felt a pain in my back like I’d never felt before. It was like someone had hit me in the back with a sledgehammer.

I was immediately afraid I had done damage to my back and/or spinal cord, so I laid down and didn’t move until someone called 911 and an ambulance arrived to take me to the hospital.

The kind folks at the skating rink got me my stuff and a mom from the party took care of my son until Amber got there.

They took X-rays and CT scans, and I was told it’s a compression fracture of the L1 vertebrae. It’s only about 20% and it’s on the opposite side of the spinal cord, so fortunately I won’t need surgery. They fit me with a brace and are giving me pain meds.

I thought ok, awesome, easy breezy. Ha ha ha. Not exactly. It’s like I’m relearning how to walk. The “brace” is more like a full body cast that covers my entire torso from neck to nether region. Fortunately I don’t wear it when I’m laying down.

I’m hoping to go home today, but it’s gonna be a lot. It’s really starting to hit me emotionally just everything I’m not going to be able to do. I’m not going to be able to finish installing the dishwasher. I’m not going to be able to install the lights in my kitchen. I’m not going to be able to clear my side yard and plant a garden this spring. And that’s just the fun extra things I wanted to get done over the next few months.

On top of that, I don’t even know how much this whole stay is gonna cost. Anyway, I’m doing ok, but I’m not good. Love y’all!
