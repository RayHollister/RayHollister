Today I decided to make an app for WebOS. Everything I hear about WebOS development tells me that it is fairly easy to develop an app on WebOS if you have a rudimentary understanding of html, css, and javascript. That’s about all that I have. I have no prior experience or education in any other programing language. I’m beginning tonight. I will update you as I progress. I am planning on making an app for my local transit companies bus system. I am probably going to have a map in it, and the bus schedules. That’s about all I can think of right now. Here I go!
