Seriously? Windows Phone Series 7 will not have cut, copy and paste? You idiots!

OK, it was bad enough that every time I saw the user interface on Microsoft’s new operating system for phones it literally made me want to throw up. (I don’t know why. It had something to do with how the virtual screen was larger than the monitor.) Now, the latest news from Redmond is that Windows Phone Series 7 phones will not have the absolutely BASIC function of copy and paste! Do the engineers at Microsoft just totally block all Apple news from passing through their firewalls? Where were they three years ago when everyone, techies and noobs, were screaming about the lack of copy and paste in the iPhone? Eh, stupid.
