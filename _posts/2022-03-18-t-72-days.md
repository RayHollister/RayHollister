I thought today was going to be a good day. I even shot this time-lapsed video this morning to show you all how “easy” it is for me to get into bed by myself now.

But today it was decidedly a very BAD day. You know it’s worse than having a broken back? Having a stomach bug and a broken back.

I could only sit up for about an hour or so, and I was running — that’s a phrase that is irrelevant to my life right now — to the bathroom constantly. Even laying on my back I couldn’t get any work done because my head and stomach was killing me.

I will spare you all of the graphic details — mostly for selfish reasons because I am to exhausted to write much more.

T-72 days.

I am too tired to write more than thank you tonight. The links are at rayhollister.com. Love y’all.
