I thought today was going to be a good day. I even shot this time-lapsed video this morning to show you all how “easy” it is for me to get into bed by myself now.

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="480" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XKN764gAGio?feature=oembed" title="March 18, 2022" width="640"></iframe></div></figure>For the record, it still took me eight minutes to get in bed.

But today it was decidedly a very BAD day. you know it’s worse than having a broken back? Having a stomach bug and a broken back.

I could only sit up for about an hour or so, and I was running — that’s a phrase that is irrelevant to my life right now — to the bathroom constantly. Even laying on my back I couldn’t get any work done because my head and stomach was killing me.

I will spare you all of the graphic details — mostly for selfish reasons because I am to exhausted to write much more.

T-72 days.

I am too tired to write more than thank you tonight. The links are at rayhollister.com. Love y’all.
