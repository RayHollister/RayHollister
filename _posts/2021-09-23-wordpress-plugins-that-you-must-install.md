Everytime I start a WordPress installation, I go through the same process of downloading and installing a bunch of plugins that are basically mandatory. If I was smart, I would build an automation that automatically downloaded them and installed them, but alas, I havenâ€™t taken the time to do that.

Until just now, I havenâ€™t even taken the time to write them down. I usually just log into one of my other sites, take note of what I installed on that one, and then start the process all over again. Iâ€™m finally writing them down, and I suppose it wouldnâ€™t hurt to publish them on the interwebs for the rest of the world to see and criticize.

To be honest, I just needed to write them down for my own future reference. If they are helpful to you or someone else, great. If you hate them or disagree with them, good for you! I couldnâ€™t really care less. ðŸ˜€

Hereâ€™s my list of WordPress plugins that you must install on almost every website:

## Mandatory For All Websites

- [Jetpack](https://jetpack.com/)
- [Akismet Anti-Spam](https://akismet.com/)
- [Redirection](https://wordpress.org/plugins/redirection/)
- [Post SMTP](https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-smtp/)
- [Yoast SEO](https://yoa.st/1uj)
- [Google Tag Manager for WordPress](http://wordpress.org/plugins/duracelltomi-google-tag-manager/)

## Mandatory For eCommerce Sites

- [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/)
- [WooCommerce Payments](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-payments/)
- [WooCommerce Shipping &amp; Tax](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-services/)
- [WooCommerce Show Attributes](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-show-attributes/)
- [Product GTIN (EAN, UPC, ISBN) for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/product-gtin-ean-upc-isbn-for-woocommerce/)
- [TI WooCommerce Wishlist](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ti-woocommerce-wishlist/)

## You Donâ€™t Need All The Time, But When You Need Them, YOU REALLY NEED THEM

- [Enable Media Replace](https://wordpress.org/plugins/enable-media-replace/)
- [Regenerate Thumbnails Advanced](https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails-advanced/)
- [Post Type Switcher](https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-type-switcher)
- [Term Management Tools](https://wordpress.org/plugins/term-management-tools/)
- [Public Post Preview](https://dominikschilling.de/wp-plugins/public-post-preview/en/)
- [WPForms](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpforms-lite/) / [Gravity Forms](https://www.gravityforms.com/) (TBH, the verdict is still out on these two IMHO, but you have to have one of them. WordPress sucks at forms.)
- [Events Manager](https://wp-events-plugin.com/) â€“ It has SO much versatility built in. I have created beautiful event calendars with it.

## Optional, But Not Really

- [Highlight and Share](https://mediaron.com/highlight-and-share)
- [Mailchimp for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mailchimp-for-woocommerce/)
- [Facebook for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/facebook-for-woocommerce/)
- [YITH WooCommerce Compare](https://wordpress.org/plugins/yith-woocommerce-compare/)
