Last night I uploaded version 0.5.0 of the JTA Bus Schedules app for WebOS. I made it so that the schedule webpage on jtafla.com opened inside of the app, instead of loading a new web browser card for each schedule.

I don’t particularly like it this way, because it doesn’t give you any feedback to let you know that the app is working. It just turns the screen white until the page loads. My plan is to add the actual schedules to the app, and then make it so the schedules launch as a separate “card stage” so that you can have multiple schedules open at the same time. I just don’t know how to do that, yet.

Also, I just found a few goofs! A few of the schedules won’t load. I’ll fix them up as soon as I get home.
