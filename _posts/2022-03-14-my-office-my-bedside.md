I think the most frustrating thing is how hard it is to do my job. It feels ridiculous. I have done *much* more physical jobs over the course of my life: pushing carts in the summer sun, standing for hours at a cash register, serving tables, washing dishes, slinging concrete and fence panels, and navigating drunk crowds with trays of drinks during St. Patrickâ€™s Day, Mardi Gras and Cinco de Mayo.

If I was doing any of those jobs, I would have to be on disability. So, Iâ€™m incredibly grateful that I can continue to be somewhat productive during my healing. But it is exhausting.

I try to put on a good face during my many Google Meet and Zoom calls, but every two hours worth of productive work takes three hours worth of energy. Iâ€™m able to do about one to two hours sitting in the chair. Then, I have to transition back into the bed with my wedge pillow. Then, I can get another hour or two of work done in the bed. Then, I have to get out of the bed. Each transition costs me upwards of an hourâ€™s worth of time. But if I stay in one position for too long, Iâ€™ll be in agony by nightfall.

Iâ€™m grateful to have a job that is flexible enough I can just work late to catch up on the time I lost during the day. But again, it seems so ridiculous! Iâ€™m just typing on a computer! Why canâ€™t I do that for hours on end? I did it before!

And donâ€™t get me wrong, Iâ€™m not belittling mental labor. Iâ€™m just at a loss for why itâ€™s so physically exhausting.

The bedside desk is super helpful, and Iâ€™ve found myself using Siri to dictate a lot of emails to save my arms from getting worn out, especially when Iâ€™m lying in bed, but as of yet, Siri is terrible at coding so itâ€™s definitely arm day when Iâ€™m writing PHP, HTML and CSS. ðŸ¤£

And look, Iâ€™m not really complaining about working 10-12 hours to get 8 hours of work done. If I wasnâ€™t working, or trying to get work done, Iâ€™d just be tinkering on one of my hobby project websites or watching TV *which is just as exhausting!* ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

T-76 days.

Enough complaining. Time for some celebrating.

You all have been so unbelievably amazing and generous. I am endlessly overwhelmed and humbled at how you all have come out to help me and Amber. Thank you so much!

Being real raw and honest for a second, I recently came to realize that I struggle a lot with my self worth. I have a hard time believing that I am worthy of being loved or cared for. Seeing your help pour in has been truly worldview shattering.

I want to thank everyone who has contributed. Iâ€™m trying to personally say thank you to every single one of you, but if I havenâ€™t said thank you yet, forgive me for being an jerk. I will eventually. Also, if I ask for your address, donâ€™t act weird about it! ðŸ˜‚ Amber just wants to send you a thank you note. Sheâ€™s analog like that. ðŸ¤£

I want to thank those if you who have helped us in ways other than on the MealTrain and the GoFundMe too. I cannot tell you how much Iâ€™ve appreciated it. Iâ€™ve literally ran out of adjectives.

Your kindness and self-sacrifice has made this incredibly tough season softer and easier for us, and I am forever grateful. Thank you.
