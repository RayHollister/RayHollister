Note to self: if you’re ever hiding from the police, it might be a good idea to get some Gas-X. #notanad

A Missouri man farted so loud that police found his hiding spot.

Liberty Police officers and Clay County Sheriff’s Deputies were out looking for a man with a felony warrant for possession of a controlled substance.

The man hid from the police, but while he were hiding he was holding one in that… as one Facebook commenter put it…

> [“He had the right to remain silent, but he didn’t have the ability.”](https://www.facebook.com/SheriffClayCo/posts/2540680519299957?comment_id=2542142699153739)

Clay County Sheriff’s department found the incident so amusing they posted on Facebook:

“If you’ve got a felony warrant for your arrest, the cops are looking for you and you pass gas so loud it gives up your hiding spot, you’re definitely having a ? day. ?
