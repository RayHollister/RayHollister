Itâ€™s funny how something as simple as a product can become so entrenched in our life that we canâ€™t imagine how we ever lived without it. I remember that I used to use Yahoo mail. I remember using Hotmail years ago. I even remember having the covetted rayhollister at aol.com email address (back when everyone assumed that all email addressses ended with @aol.com)

Today when I logged into my Gmail account, I noticed that they were letting everyone know that it was [the day after Gmailâ€™s 5th birthday](http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2009/04/gmail-turns-5.html "http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2009/04/gmail-turns-5.html"). (Gmail was launched on April 1, but as you may know, [Google loves April fools day](http://mail.google.com/mail/help/autopilot/index.html "http://mail.google.com/mail/help/autopilot/index.html").)

I had to think about it for a minute and remember a time before tagging, when I had to sort my emails into folders if I ever expected to find them again. Back when I used three different programs to [chat](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/02/chat-email-crazy-delicious.html "http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/02/chat-email-crazy-delicious.html") with people. Back when [video chatting ](http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2008/11/say-hello-to-gmail-voice-and-video-chat.html "http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2008/11/say-hello-to-gmail-voice-and-video-chat.html")was still some futuristic possibility.

It gave me a cold shiver.

[Happy Birthday Gmail](http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2009/04/gmail-turns-5.html "http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2009/04/gmail-turns-5.html"). Itâ€™s been a better Internet since you came into the world. (Even with that big [goof up back in February](http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2009/02/update-on-todays-gmail-outage.html "http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2009/02/update-on-todays-gmail-outage.html")!)

By the way, everyone that I know of that is on Gmail is on Gmail because I invited them way back when! ðŸ™‚ You all can thank me.

In retrospect, I wish I had been smart enough to [sell off the invitations](http://news.cnet.com/2100-1023_3-5203162.html "http://news.cnet.com/2100-1023_3-5203162.html")!
