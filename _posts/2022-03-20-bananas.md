Got some serious work done today trimming the dead winter leaves off of the banana trees and trimming the trunk down to fresh growth so that they’ll hopefully fruit this year and give us some good bananas! 🍌🍌🍌

NAH! Just kidding! 🤣 I was barely outside long enough to get the photo!

Between my “long” walk yesterday and working most of this weekend getting a couple of projects for work done, I was tuckered out today.

I convinced — well, guilted — Amber into trimming the bananas for me. With the last freeze hitting us in February, the leaves on them were long since destroyed, and they were starting to rot now that the trees were trying to grow again. I was afraid the dead leaves and branches would stunt their growth if they weren’t removed soon.

She begrudgingly wore herself out pruning them and cutting a fresh start for the trunk. I had completely forgotten that she pulled a muscle in her back last night, and she forgot to remind me.

We’re trying to be better at communicating, but sometimes we still suck.
