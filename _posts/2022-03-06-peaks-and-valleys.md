Yesterday started off really great, went deep into the pits of hell, but came out good in the end. I managed to walk out onto the front porch to drink my coffee yesterday which was amazing. It helped restore a tiny sense of normalcy to my life.

Then, just a few short minutes later, I started a huge fight with Amber over a really simple miscommunication.

After a lot of regretful behavior on my part, Amber took to the kids to spend the night at some friends and family, which we already had planned, and then she came back and we worked through what had happened.

After talking through everything, I came to realize that my anger was really misplaced and compounded fear. I was hysterically paranoid that she was being dishonest with me over something that was plainly and clearly a tiny miscommunication. I let all my fear, anxiety and exhaustion from everything that happened the entire week boil over and explode at Amber.

I apologized profusely to Amber, and we talked about everything we had just gone though and how it had affected us. We even discovered the root causes of some of our conflicts that have plagued us our entire marriage. In the end, it was very cathartic and healing. We still have a lot of work ahead of us, but I’m so glad I’m in it with her.
