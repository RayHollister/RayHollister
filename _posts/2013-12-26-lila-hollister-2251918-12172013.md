As you may know, my grandmother, Lila Hollister, passed away on December 17, 2013. She lived a long and happy life, and she is now at peace. I have included a few links below to memorials to her.

You may be looking for the [photo slideshow that was presented at Lila Hollister’s funeral](https://rayhollister.com/lila). You can find it at the link above or here at <https://rayhollister.com/lila>

Also, here is a link to [Lila Hollister’s obituary](http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/timesunion/obituary.aspx?page=lifestory&pid=168632418) and to [her guest book](http://www.legacy.com/guestbooks/timesunion/guestbook.aspx?n=lila-hollister&pid=168632418&cid=full#sthash.knxakmOk.dpbs).

[Lila Hollister’s gravestone](http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GSln=Hollister&GSiman=1&GScid=71953&GRid=114040924&) hasn’t been updated on the website yet, but it can be seen here.
