[![](https://www.rayhollister.com/media/2010/02/Sprint-Logo-300x157.jpg "Sprint Logo")](http://www.sprint.com/)So, I normally don’t talk about customer service unless it stinks, but I just got off a web chat with [Sprint](http://www.sprint.com/) and they rocked. Long story short, we accidentally had two phone plans on our account instead of one, and we didn’t realize it until this month. So, I got on the chat with a Bruce K. who got me straightened out in less than 45 minutes. I was ready to lay the smack down and fight to get a credit of the overcharge, but all I had to do was explain the situation. He was completely professional about it, and took care of it [lickety-split.](http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2164/whats-the-origin-of-lickety-split) If you happen to be reading this Bruce K, Thanks again! – [Ray Hollister](https://www.rayhollister.com)
